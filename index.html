        <h6>Bilingual in programming languages</h6>
        <p>
            I currently know C++, Linux, Ruby,  and Java. I will soon start learning Python and C#.
            C++ is my most understand language, but I what I don't know I will learn whether it be self-taught or trained.
        </p>

        <h6>Teamplayer</h6>
        <p>
            I can work alone but I prefer to work with others. I enjoy working on projects with a team, merging ideas and learning from eachother.
        </p>

        <h6>Works well underpessure</h6>
        <p>
            Even if it's slightly stressful, I've realized my brain works best underpressure. 
            I become more focused and more motivated when I am competing against someone or for something.
        </p>

        <h6>Computer literate</h6>
        <p>
            I am a huge fan of computer technology. 
            There is still a lot I don't know but I always enjoy learning something knew related to computers, software and hardware.

        <p>I've always struggled to stay interested in my classes. I figured I just couldn't focus, or College wasn't meant for me. It wasn't until I made the decision to switch to Computer Science and
        begin to self teach myself coding that I realized that I was just in the wrong field. Since I've been a CS major, I never one regretted my choice to be one. I always felt a sense of accomplishment
        and fullfilment when I complete a project/course/homework. Computer Science is not easy whatsoever, it's challenging, mind numbing, and exhausting. Even with those struggles, the gain I get after completing
        something far out weighs the struggles.

        There are so many opportunities within this major that, in my opinion, it's impossible for me to pick just one field within this major. I still have a lot to learn, but I do know that any career I choose where I can 
        build something from nothing, is where I want to work. Game development, cyber security, web development, internet programming, and the list goes on.
        The best way to narrow down what career I want to go into is by providing a what I think my ideal workplace will be like. Teamwork will be involved, competition, creating something from nothing, friendly evironment,
        healthy workplace, and most importantly, it involves coding. If I can find any career within that criteria then I will put my full heart into that career.

                I have been a member of ACM for 2 years. It's a great organization that is focused mainly for Computer Science majors. We hold events promoting ways to become more successful.
                We attend hackathons where we compete against many other students in regards to creating some kind of program using code.
                We volunteer for many events on campus and sometimes off campus. Often times we are given the opportunity to teach young students in high school/middle school things that are related to programming.
                It's a positive and fulfilling organization that has brought me great friends and tremendous knowledge.

            <h6>My first coded project</h6>
            <p>
                This is what prompted me to want to become a Computer Science Major. I remember finishing my final for Macro Economics and not feeling like I was meant to be a Business Major.
                I went home and went on khanacademy.org and learned how to code. I spent hours creating my first drawing out of code and it was at that moment that I realized what I was meant to do.
                This project changed my lifestyle and my career path. It's not very good but the sense of accomplisment I got from learning something on my own and creating something from nothing we
                motivational and pleasing. The link to what I created is below

            <h6>First Text Based Game</h6>
            <p>
                This was a project that I worked on with another one of my classmates. We designed a text based game that was story driven and depending on what decision you made, it would change the outcome of the game.
                We spent countless nights creating this. To finish the full game it would take atleast a half an hour, all depends on whether you made the right decisions. We added 3 possible endings to the story, none of 
                which let you survive, in this game the villain always wins(shhh don't tell anyone). It was a very exhausting game, we ended up pulling an all nighter at the end to finish. It was fun to be able to create 
                your very own story, with your own plot, characters and bring them to life with text. This was the longest project I have done but it felt great knowing that this was the first game I have ever created.
